## Engineering Notes
I'm a data engineer / data scientist in the Philadelphia area, sharing notes on my everyday tech challenges and failures.

## CHOP Advocacy

I'm also actively involved in supporting the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) oncology department, through fundraising for their annual Parkway Run.

After a series of health issues, my daughter Veronika was diagnosed at age 16 with a germinoma - a type of brain cancer. Fortunately, these types of tumors are treatable with chemotherapy and radiation. 

We are so lucky to have a world-class children's hospital in our vicinity. Veronika was well cared for at CHOP - from diagnosis through to post-treatment. 

It's a joy and a privilege to continue working with CHOP by participating in the Parkway Run. The run raises money for pediatric cancer research. 

In 2024, Veronika was selected as one of the event's ambassadors and the 2024 run raised almost 2 million dollars!
